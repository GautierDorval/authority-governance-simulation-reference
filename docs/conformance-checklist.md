# Conformance checklist (conceptual)

This checklist is descriptive only.

## Boundary

- inference never implies authority
- unknown remains explicit

## Authority governance primitives

- taxonomy classification exists
- policy outcomes are conservative by default
- proofs are pointers, not invented content
- ledger exists for deny / escalate / simulate / allow

## Ops pack primitives

- human oversight gates exist for critical actions
- privacy and minimization are respected
- change control and drift detection exist
- injection and exfiltration risks are considered
- incident response exists (kill switch concept)
