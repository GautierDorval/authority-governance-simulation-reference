This repository is an illustrative, non-normative reference.

External contributions are **not accepted by default**.

If you believe a correction is necessary:
- open an issue describing the problem,
- do not submit pull requests without prior agreement.

This policy exists to prevent:
- accidental operationalization,
- dilution of non-goals,
- divergence from the normative standard.
