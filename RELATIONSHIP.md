# Relationship to the normative standard

This repository is a simulation-only reference.

The normative definitions of Authority Governance and the Agentic Operations Pack
are defined in:

https://github.com/GautierDorval/interpretive-governance-manifest

This repository:
- does not define conformance,
- does not extend the standard,
- does not replace normative artifacts.

If a discrepancy exists, the normative repository prevails.
